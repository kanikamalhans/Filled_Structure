The errors you're encountering seem to be related to two main issues: `topojson-client` and `react-chartjs-2` library problems. Let's break down each error and how to potentially resolve them:

### Error 1: TypeError in `topojson-client`

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')
at feature_default (topojson-client.js?v=952929b2:70:12)
at USAMap.jsx:29:21
```

**Understanding the Error:**
- This error typically occurs when there's an issue with data processing in the `topojson-client` library, possibly due to incorrect data structure or missing properties.

**Potential Solution:**
- Double-check the data you are passing to `topojson-client`. Ensure it matches the expected format and structure required by the library.
- Verify that the data source (e.g., GeoJSON or TopoJSON file) is correctly loaded and parsed before passing it to `topojson-client`.
- Check for any asynchronous data loading issues that might result in `undefined` or `null` values being passed to `topojson-client`.

### Error 2: Errors in `react-chartjs-2`

#### Error 2.1: `"category" is not a registered scale`

```
Error: "category" is not a registered scale.
at Registry._get (react-chartjs-2.js?v=952929b2:7961:13)
```

**Understanding the Error:**
- This error suggests that the Chart.js scale type (`category`) used in your chart configuration might not be correctly registered or initialized.

**Potential Solution:**
- Ensure that you are using the correct scale type (`category`) and that it is properly imported and registered with Chart.js.
- Verify that the version of Chart.js used by `react-chartjs-2` is compatible with the scale types you are using.
- Check for any misconfiguration in your chart component where the scale might be incorrectly specified or initialized.

#### Error 2.2: `"arc" is not a registered element`

```
Error: "arc" is not a registered element.
at Registry._get (react-chartjs-2.js?v=952929b2:7961:13)
```

**Understanding the Error:**
- This error indicates that the Chart.js element type (`arc`) used in your chart configuration might not be recognized or properly registered.

**Potential Solution:**
- Ensure that you are correctly importing and registering all required Chart.js elements (`arc`, `line`, `bar`, etc.) within your chart components.
- Double-check the version compatibility between `react-chartjs-2` and Chart.js to ensure all elements and features are supported.
- Verify that your chart configuration is correctly specifying the type of chart (e.g., `Doughnut`, `Pie`, `Bar`) and using the appropriate elements (`arc`, `line`, etc.).

### Next Steps:

1. **Review Component Implementations:**
   - Go through each component (`USAMap.jsx`, `BarChart.jsx`, `DoughnutChart.jsx`, etc.) where these errors occur.
   - Verify data formats, library imports, and component configurations against the library documentation.

2. **Check Data Loading and Processing:**
   - Ensure that any data being passed to charts or maps is correctly formatted and accessible at runtime.
   - Handle any asynchronous loading errors gracefully to prevent `undefined` or `null` values.

3. **Update Library Versions:**
   - If possible, update `topojson-client`, `react-chartjs-2`, and related dependencies to their latest versions to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.

By addressing these issues methodically and verifying each component's implementation against the library requirements, you should be able to resolve these errors and get your application running smoothly. If you need further assistance with specific code snippets or configurations, feel free to ask!
